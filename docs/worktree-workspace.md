# Worktree Workspace

Start a new AI-OS session any time, on a clean `main`, even when other sessions
have uncommitted work on other branches. No stash prompt, no committing someone
else's work first, and your memory never splits.

## The problem this fixes

Git lets one folder sit on only one branch at a time. So if every session opens
the same AI-OS folder, two sessions cannot be on two branches at once. When one
session has uncommitted work and you start another, Claude Desktop pops a
**Stash / Discard / Commit** box and blocks you until you pick one. (That box is a
Claude Desktop behavior, tracked upstream as issue #62142. No file on your machine
can switch it off.)

The normal fix is **git worktrees**: each session gets its own folder, on its own
branch, all sharing one git history. Claude Desktop already does this automatically
for your other projects.

But AI-OS could not use worktrees safely on its own, because your **brain is
gitignored**: `context/memory/`, `MEMORY.md`, `learnings.md`, `.env`, the command
centre's data, the memsearch index. Git does not copy gitignored files into a
worktree. So a raw worktree would boot with **empty memory** and every session
would drift apart. That is why AI-OS used one shared folder, and why the stash box
kept blocking you.

## How the fix works

Each worktree gets its own folder and branch (isolation), but its brain is
**symlinked back to the one real copy** in your primary checkout. So sessions are
isolated for code, and unified for memory. One brain, many hands.

```
~/Desktop/AI/AI-OS                 <- PRIMARY. Stays on clean main. Holds the one real brain.
~/Desktop/Worktrees/AI-OS/<name>   <- a session worktree on branch work/<name>
   context/memory/2026-06-23.md    --> symlink --> primary's context/memory/2026-06-23.md
   context/MEMORY.md               --> symlink --> primary's context/MEMORY.md
   .env, .mcp.json, .command-centre, .memsearch, ... all symlinked to primary
```

What is shared (symlinked, so it never forks): `.env`, `.mcp.json`,
`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/skills/_catalog/installed.json`,
`.command-centre/`, `.memsearch/`, `context/MEMORY.md`, `context/learnings.md`,
`context/memory/`, `context/transcripts/`, `context/_private/`, `context/notion/`,
and the same set under each `clients/<x>/`.

What is NOT shared (it comes from git, already the same everywhere): your tracked
files - skills, scripts, `projects/`, `brand_context/`, docs, the codebase.

## The two ways a worktree gets made

1. **Automatic (Claude Desktop).** With per-session worktrees turned on in Claude
   Desktop, every new session lands in its own worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`.
   The SessionStart hook `worktree-data-link.js` runs first, before memory loads,
   and links the brain in. You do nothing.
2. **On demand (one command).** `bash scripts/worktree-new.sh <name>` makes a clean
   worktree from `main`, links the brain, and prints the folder to open.

Either way the brain is linked automatically. The hook re-links every session
start, so newly added memory files get picked up too.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `bash scripts/worktree-new.sh <name>`  | Make a clean isolated session folder (branch `work/<name>` from main), brain linked. Prints the path to open. |
| `bash scripts/worktree-list.sh`        | List all worktrees (the first is your primary/home). |
| `bash scripts/worktree-done.sh <name>` | Remove a worktree. Keeps its commits as an archive tag if it had any, drops the branch if not. Your brain is never touched. |
| `bash scripts/worktree-link.sh [path]` | Re-link the brain into a worktree by hand (the hook calls this for you). |

## Rules that keep it working

- **The primary checkout (`~/Desktop/AI/AI-OS`) stays on `main` and stays clean.**
  It is home base and the single source of the brain. Do real branch work in a
  worktree, not in the primary. A clean primary is what makes "start a new session
  any time" never hit the stash box.
- **Worktrees are disposable.** Commit what you want to keep, then
  `worktree-done`. Nothing in a worktree holds your only copy of anything: the
  brain lives in the primary, code lives in git.
- **Nothing is ever hard-deleted.** `worktree-done` archives branch commits to a
  tag before dropping the branch (same no-delete rule as the rest of AI-OS).

## Safety

- `worktree-link.sh` only ever creates symlinks. It never deletes and never
  overwrites a real file - if a real file already sits where a link would go, it
  leaves it alone and says so.
- If Claude Desktop's worktree auto-cleanup ever removes a worktree, your memory is
  safe: the worktree held only symlinks, the real files are in the primary.
- This builds on the existing coexistence safety net (`~/.claude/coexistence`,
  `epitaxy-stash-guard.js`): if a stray stash ever happens, that net still recovers
  it. Worktrees stop the collisions; the net is the backstop.
