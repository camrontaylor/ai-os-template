# Derive the AI-OS CANONICAL MemSearch collection name for the current checkout.
#
# IMPORTANT - this is DELIBERATELY different from the memsearch plugin's own
# collection. The plugin derives "ms_<name>_<hash>"; AI-OS uses
# "ms_<name>_<hash>_aios". They must NOT be the same. Why:
#   The memsearch plugin re-indexes ONLY its .memsearch/memory/ shadow folder
#   after every session, and `memsearch index` does a DESTRUCTIVE sync - it
#   deletes every source that is not in the paths it was just given. When the
#   plugin and AI-OS shared one collection, the plugin wiped AI-OS's full index
#   (memory, transcripts, learnings, brand, notion) down to just the shadow on
#   every single session. Giving AI-OS its own "_aios" collection means the
#   plugin can only ever clobber its own shadow box, never the canonical index
#   that AI-OS cron indexing and runtime recall read.
# All AI-OS callers (cron jobs, AGENTS.md recall) resolve their collection
# through THIS script, so this one change re-points all of them together.
