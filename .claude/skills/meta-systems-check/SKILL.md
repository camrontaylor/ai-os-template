name: meta-systems-check
description: Run a full health check of the AI-OS install and report a plain-English scorecard of what works, what is missing, and what is broken. Triggers on "systems check", "health check", "is everything working", "is AI-OS healthy", "check my setup", "what is broken", "diagnose AI-OS", "run a diagnostic", "check the system", "is everything connected", "did anything break". Runs a read-only script that inspects Node and Command Centre deps, the cron daemon, semantic memory, API keys, brand context, client folders, the git backup remote, version vs changelog, the memory budget, and settings. Reports critical, warnings, info, and OK with a one-line fix each. Does NOT trigger for cron status alone (use ops-cron), memory recall (use memory-recall), or worktree and branch audits (use meta-worktree).

# meta-systems-check

Checks whether the AI-OS install is healthy and tells the user, in plain words, what works, what is missing, and what is broken.

## When to use

The user asks whether the system is healthy, working, set up correctly, connected, or whether anything is broken. Examples: "is everything working", "run a systems check", "what's broken", "is my AI-OS set up right", "did the install work".

## When NOT to use

- Just the cron schedule or job status, use `ops-cron`.
- Recalling a past fact or memory, use `memory-recall`.
- Git branches, worktrees, dirty work, or "where is my work", use `meta-worktree`.

## How to run

Run the read-only check script from the repo root:

    bash .claude/skills/meta-systems-check/scripts/check.sh

It changes nothing. It prints a scorecard grouped as CRITICAL, WARNINGS, INFO, and OK, each finding with a one-line fix, plus a summary line and an overall HEALTHY or NEEDS ATTENTION status.

## How to present the result

1. Lead with the overall status (HEALTHY or NEEDS ATTENTION) in one line.
2. List the CRITICAL items first, each with its exact fix command. These block the system.
3. Then the WARNINGS, then anything from INFO worth flagging.
4. Skip or compress the OK list unless the user wants the full picture.
5. End with one recommendation: the single highest-leverage fix to run next.

Keep it plain. Translate any jargon. Never print secret values; the script reports key names and counts only, never the keys themselves.

## What it checks

- Node runtime, and the Command Centre dependencies (better-sqlite3).
- The onboarding command is present.
- The nightly cron daemon (macOS launchd): loaded, off, or stalled.
- Semantic memory (memsearch) installed.
- API keys: how many documented keys are set vs missing (names only).
- Brand context: whether onboarding has been run.
- Client folders: each has its AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and .claude/commands.
- Git backup remote: your own, the template's, or none.
- VERSION vs CHANGELOG.
- The MEMORY.md character budget.
- Claude settings.json is valid JSON.

## Rules

- Read-only. The skill never changes anything; it only reports. If the user wants a fix applied, do that as a separate, explicit step.
- After presenting, offer to apply the top one or two fixes, but do not auto-fix.
- The cron check is macOS-first; on other systems that one check is skipped, not failed.
