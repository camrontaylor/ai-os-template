## Triage (the assess trigger)

_Empty - move a candidate here from the backlog to trigger meta-skill-intake's full assessment._

## Review (awaiting your sign-off)

_Empty - a skill lands here with its ASSESSMENT.md and a Notion task once the assessment is done._

### Thinking & Decisions

_1 total · 0 net-new, 1 absorbed into AI-OS core (thinking-partner -> AGENTS.md "Thinking Discipline" + context/thinking/)._

| thinking-partner | core | Deterministic thinking partner: challenges assumptions, detects orientation capture (GT0 to GT7), deploys 8 named pushback probes, and applies 150+ mental models on demand. Capability is core posture, not an invokable skill, so it was absorbed into AI-OS core instead of promoted to a `/` skill. | absorbed -> AGENTS.md "Thinking Discipline" + context/thinking/{diagnostics.md, model-catalog.md} | always-on; activates on every turn that involves a real decision, ambiguous question, or high-stakes call. Session-only off-switch: "thinking partner off" | mattnowdev/thinking-partner |

## Legend

**Cat prefixes:** `sec` = security · `mkt` = marketing · `str` = strategy · `ops` = operations / client delivery · `eng` = engineering · `viz` = visual / design · `tool` = utility / integration.

**Active dup? = yes** means the skill duplicates a capability already live in AGENTS.md, so Task-Routing skips it - it stays here for reference only. **no** means net-new: a capability the active set does not yet cover.
